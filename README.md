# Virtual Entomology Collection 

A web application designed as a stand-in to traditional physical insect collection assignments. This tool allows students to digitally collect, process, 'pin', and label insect specimens in a scientifically accurate virtual environment.

## Overview

This application provides a digital alternative to an insect collection assignment. It eliminates the ethical concerns and logistical challenges of physical collection while maintaining the value of taxonomy, identification, and curation. This approach has limitations! Traditional taxonomic skills are a crucial part of entomology and collecting, pinning, labelling and recording are part and parcel of that. This is a starting point and a springboard for ethical discussion. 

### Key Features
*   **Virtual Pinning Studio:** Upload photos and place a virtual pin specifically on the thorax/notum.
*   **Image Processing:** Built-in tools to crop, rotate, and remove backgrounds (Magic Wand & Brush) for professional-looking specimens.
*   **Taxonomic Data Entry:** Fields for Order, Family, Genus, Species, and evolutionary history.
*   **Multi-Drawer Management:** Organise specimens into multiple drawers with custom names.
*   **Local Persistence:** Data is stored automatically in the browser, with JSON export options for backup and submission.
*   **Instructor Mode:** A dedicated admin interface for grading student submissions.

    *   **Clean Up:** Use the "Auto Remove" (Magic Wand) or "Highlight Remove" (Brush) to remove the background.
5.  **Pinning:** Click on the appropriate part of the insect to place the virtual pin.
6.  **Taxonomy:** Fill in the classification details (Phylum, Class, Order, etc.) and collection data (Date, Location).
7.  **Save:** Click "Save Specimen" to add it to the drawer.

### 3. Submitting Your Assignment
**Crucial Step:** Since this app does not use a cloud database, you must export your file to submit it.
1.  Ensure all your specimens are saved.
2.  Click the **"Save Progress"** (Download) button in the top right header.
3.  This will download a `.json` file named like `123456_John_Doe_Collection.json`.
4.  Submit this file to your learning management system (Canvas, Blackboard, etc.).
